## General
For the course Browser Technologies, had to make a interactive application with the knowledge we gain about Progressive Enhancement.

## User Story
I want to be able to fill out a survey about the Web Development minor, with different response options. I want to see clearly where I am and how much I have left to do. I want to be able to revise previously completed questions. If I don't finish the survey, I want to pick up where I left off later.

## [Minor Enquête](rainbowjm.github.io/minor-enquete-bt/)
### Intro
The final product is a application where you can fill the enquête, no matter what device you are using. 

The enquête consiste of a part where the student entrees his/hers information and then they get access to do the enquête.

### Questions:
1. How good was this course?*
2. In which semester did you follow this course?*
3. What number would you give the difficulty of the curriculum?*
4. Give you opinion about the course:
5. What number would you give curriculum explanation?*
6. How good did you understand this course?*

For each course the studtent has to answer the same question, out of the 6 question, 5 of them are mandatory(*).

The aspect that was taken while making this application was, that the user has to be validated before theuy can fill in the enquête.
Another aspect that could have been taken was, that you can fill the enquête as anonouymos, with this version you would get more sincere answer.
